# Laptop Recommendation System


## Project Overview

This project was developed for Microsoft Engage 2022. It is a laptop recommendation system built using Streamlit and Python. The system leverages cosine similarity to provide users with personalized laptop recommendations based on their preferences.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive user experience.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Utilizes cosine similarity to recommend laptops that best match the user's criteria.
- **Efficient Recommendations**: Quickly processes user input to provide relevant laptop suggestions.

# Algorithms in Recommendation Engines
In this project, I also demonstrate the role of various algorithms used in recommendation engines for web-streaming apps like Netflix and audio-streaming apps like Spotify. Here are some of the algorithms highlighted:

# Content-Based Filtering
Role in Recommendation Engine:

1. Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those the user has interacted with in the past.
2. Uses item features and user profiles to match preferences.

## Usage
A. Open the Streamlit application in your web browser.
B. Input your laptop preferences.
C. Receive personalized laptop recommendations based on cosine similarity.
